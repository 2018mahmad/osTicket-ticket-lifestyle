## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the complete ticket lifecycle within an osTicket Help Desk Ticketing System, from initial ticket creation to resolution and closure. The focus is on showing how IT support teams intake requests, prioritize incidents using SLAs, triage issues, escalate when necessary, and document resolutions following IT Service Management (ITSM) best practices.
This project aligns with real-world responsibilities for **IT Support**, **Help Desk Technician**, and **Service Desk Analyst** roles.

The following video tutorial covers intake, assignment, triaging, and closing tickets within osTicket:</p>

## 🎯 Business Problem

Without a structured workflow, support requests can become disorganized, delayed, or unresolved. Organizations need a standardized ticket lifecycle to ensure consistent handling, prioritization, and documentation of incidents and service requests.

This project implements a structured workflow that improves:

- Response time  
- Ticket visibility  
- Accountability  
- Customer satisfaction  

## ⚙️ Ticket Lifecycle Stages

1. Ticket Intake (User or Agent Submission)  
2. Assignment & Communication  
3. Triaging & Escalation  
4. Working the Issue  
5. Resolution & Closure

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Windows 10 Pro (21H2)  
- Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines  
- osTicket  
- Internet Information Services (IIS)  
- MySQL  
- PHP  
- Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)

## 🏗️ Environment Overview

- Windows 10 virtual machine hosting IIS  
- osTicket deployed as a web application  
- MySQL backend database  
- Agent and Admin panels used to manage tickets

## ⏱️ SLA & Priority Demonstration

Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are used to prioritize tickets based on severity:

- **Sev-A (1 hour, 24/7):** Critical system outages  
- **Sev-B (4 hours, 24/7):** High-priority software or business-impacting issues  
- **Sev-C (2 hours, business hours):** Low-priority issues such as slow performance or minor requests  

This ensures critical incidents are addressed immediately while lower-priority issues are handled efficiently.

## 🔧 Triage & Escalation

- Tickets are evaluated for severity and impact  
- Low-level issues handled by Level I support  
- Complex issues escalated to Level II or System Administrators  
- Communication maintained with users throughout the process

## 📚 What I Learned

- Implementing structured ticket workflows  
- Applying ITSM principles  
- Using SLAs to manage priorities  
- Documenting troubleshooting and resolutions  
- Communicating effectively with users
